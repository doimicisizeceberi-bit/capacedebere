Here’s a concept-first layout and feature set, no code yet.

🧭 Core Purpose

Make it fast to find, verify, fix, and improve photos across your entire collection.

This page shouldn’t just answer “is there a photo?”
It should answer:

Is the photo correct

Is it good quality

Is it consistent with the rest of the archive

🏗️ Page Structure Concept
1️⃣ Top Summary Bar (Mission Control)

At the top, show quick stats:

📸 Total caps: 1,284

❌ Missing photos: 37

⚠️ Low-quality photos: 112

🔁 Duplicates detected: 5

🕒 Last upload: 2 days ago

This gives you instant motivation and context.

2️⃣ Filter Panel (Left or Top)

Instead of scrolling endlessly, you “slice” the collection.

Essential Filters

Status

Missing photo

Has photo

Flagged for review

Country

Beer name (search)

Date added

Recently edited

Smart Filters (Power Tools)

“Show only caps added in last 30 days without photos”

“Show photos smaller than X KB” (proxy for low quality)

“Show all caps with same beer name”

3️⃣ Main Grid (Visual First, Not Table First)

This page should be image-driven, not text-driven.

Layout Idea

A photo wall instead of rows:

[Thumb]  [Thumb]  [Missing]
[Thumb]  [Flagged] [Thumb]


Each tile shows:

Beer name

Cap no

Country

Status badge (Missing / OK / Flagged)

Missing Photos Look Different

Big empty tile:

📷 Missing
Tucher — #3 — Germany
[Upload]

So your eyes go straight to the problem.

4️⃣ Click = Audit Panel (Right Side Drawer)

When you click a cap, a side panel slides in instead of a new page.

Shows:

Full-size photo

Filename

Cap metadata

Tags

Barcodes count

History:

When photo added

Last replaced

Who/what did it (later: user role)

Action Buttons:

🔄 Replace photo

🏷 Add tag (“bad crop”, “low res”, “wrong cap”)

❌ Mark as incorrect

✅ Mark as verified

This makes it feel like a curation tool, not a CRUD form.

5️⃣ Quality Tools (The Fun Part)
Auto Flags

You can define “bad photo” rules later:

Resolution below 500x500

File size under 50KB

Not square

Too dark / too bright (advanced later)

Then:

⚠️ 23 photos flagged for review

6️⃣ Bulk Actions (Huge Time Saver)

Sometimes you’ll want to clean up in batches:

Select 10 caps

Click:

“Mark verified”

“Tag as low quality”

“Export list”

This turns hours of work into minutes.

7️⃣ Comparison Mode (Collector Power Feature)

For caps with same beer name:

“Compare all Tucher caps”

Shows them side-by-side:

[Cap #1] [Cap #2] [Cap #3]


Perfect for spotting wrong uploads or duplicates.

🎯 Status System (Simple but Powerful)

Each cap gets a photo status (not just “has photo”)

Suggested statuses:

🟥 Missing

🟨 Needs Review

🟩 Verified

🟦 Reference Photo (placeholder, temporary)

This can live as:

A tag

Or a future photo_status column

🧠 Smart Workflow

Your “Add Cap” → “Upload Photo” → “Photo Audit” flow becomes:

Add cap

Upload photo

Audit page auto shows:

“1 new photo needs verification”

That’s museum-grade design thinking.

🧩 Future-Proof Hooks (Even if you don’t build now)

Design the page so later you can add:

User roles (“verified by admin”)

Photo history (versioning)

AI detection (blur, brightness, duplicates)

Public gallery view

⭐ My Recommendation for v1

Don’t try to build everything at once.

Phase 1 Concept

Visual grid

Filter: Missing / Has photo

Click → side panel

Replace photo button

That alone will feel professional and powerful.

🔥 Question for you (this affects the whole design)

Do you see this archive as:
A) Personal collection tool
B) Museum-style digital archive
C) Public browsing site someday
